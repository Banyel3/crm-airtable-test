# Field Order Update - Summary

## Changes Made

The script has been updated to ensure that Airtable fields are created in the **same order** as they appear in Zoho CRM, with proper field type mapping.

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **Added `get_module_fields()` to ZohoCRMClient**

- Fetches field definitions from Zoho CRM including data types
- Preserves the order of fields as defined in CRM
- Returns field metadata: api_name, data_type, etc.

#### 2. **Added `map_zoho_to_airtable_type()` to AirtableClient**

- Maps Zoho field types to Airtable field types
- Supports: currency, decimal, integer, boolean, date, datetime, email, phone, url, text, picklist, lookup, etc.
- **Important**: Boolean fields are mapped to `singleLineText` with "Yes"/"No" values to avoid checkbox type issues

#### 3. **Added `ensure_fields_exist()` to AirtableClient**

- Creates fields in Airtable in the **exact order** from Zoho CRM
- Uses case-insensitive field name matching to avoid duplicates
- Detects existing fields with type mismatches and warns user
- Creates fields one by one to preserve order

#### 4. **Updated `sync_module()` workflow**

Now follows this order:

1.  Fetch field definitions from Zoho (with order preserved)
2.  Build ordered list of (field_name, field_config) tuples
3.  Create missing fields in Airtable (in CRM order)
4.  Fetch records from Zoho
5.  Convert records to Airtable format
6.  Import records to Airtable

#### 5. **Updated `convert_zoho_to_airtable()`**

- Simplified skip_fields to only exclude 'id'
- Strips '$' prefix from system field names
- Converts booleans to "Yes"/"No" text
- Preserves all other fields from Zoho

### Field Type Mapping

| Zoho Type | Airtable Type  | Options              |
| --------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| currency  | currency       | precision: 2         |
| decimal   | number         | precision: 2         |
| integer   | number         | precision: 0         |
| boolean   | singleLineText | stored as "Yes"/"No" |
| date      | date           | ISO format           |
| datetime  | dateTime       | ISO format, UTC, 24h |
| email     | email          | -                    |
| phone     | phoneNumber    | -                    |
| url       | url            | -                    |
| text      | singleLineText | -                    |
| textarea  | multilineText  | -                    |
| picklist  | singleLineText | -                    |
| lookup    | singleLineText | -                    |

### Handling Existing Fields

When a field already exists in Airtable:

- **Same type**: Field is skipped (no action needed)
- **Different type**: Warning is displayed:
  ```
  ⚠️  Field 'Annual_Revenue' exists but has type 'singleLineText' (expected 'currency')
      You may need to delete and recreate this field manually in Airtable
  ```

### How to Fix Type Mismatches

If you see warnings about field type mismatches:

1. Go to your Airtable base: https://airtable.com/{YOUR_BASE_ID}
2. Find the field with the wrong type
3. Delete the field (this will delete any data in that field)
4. Run the script again - the field will be recreated with the correct type

**OR**

Delete the entire table in Airtable and let the script recreate everything from scratch with correct types and order.

## Testing the Changes

To test the updated script:

```powershell
python sync_zoho_to_airtable.py
```

The script will:

1. Fetch field definitions from Zoho CRM
2. Display how many fields were found
3. Create missing fields in the correct order
4. Show warnings for any type mismatches
5. Import the data

## Next Steps

If you encounter the "Annual_Revenue" error again, you should:

1. Delete the "Annual_Revenue" field in Airtable
2. Re-run the script - it will recreate the field with the correct `currency` type
